## Design and implement a class called Sphere that contains instance data that represents the sphereâ€™s diameter.  
1) Define the Sphere constructor to accept and initialize the diameter, and include getter and setter methods for the diameter.  
2) Include methods that calculate and return the volume and surface area of the sphere.  
3) Create a driver class called Main, and update several Sphere objects.
