### Create a class called Book to represent a book.  
1) A Book should include four pieces of information as instance variables‚Äêa book name, an ISBN number, an author name and a publisher.  
2) Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four instance variables.  
3) Provide a mutator method and accessor method (query method) for each instance variable.  
4) You should use the "this" keyword in member methods and constructor.  
5) Write a test application named BookTest that tests the methods you have written.
