## Create a class called Date that includes three pieces of information as instance variables—a month (type int), a day (type int), and a year (type int).  
1) Your class should have a constructor that initializes the three instance variables and assumes that the values provided are correct.  
2) Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable.  
3) Provide a method displayDate that displays the day, month, and year separated by forward slashes(/).  
4) Write a test application named Main that demonstrates class Date’s capabilities.
